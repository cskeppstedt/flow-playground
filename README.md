# flow-playground

A repo where I'm evaluating [Flow](facebook/flow). I'm focusing on finding
use-cases where the type system would catch things that you could miss by only
relying on unit- or feature tests. My thoughts/findings will probably be
maintained in [notes.md](notes.md).

## Running the project

There's a mocha test-runner set up so that it will also run `flow` and
`eslint`.  It's kind of a hack but gets the job done for now.

    npm install && npm start
